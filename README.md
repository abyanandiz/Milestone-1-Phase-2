# Objective
Create a model for predicting whether the shipment was on-time or not.

Compare the performance between each algorithm as follows:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes

Decide which algorithm that we will use based on the best performance on the chosen metrics.
Analyze which part of the model needs to be improved based on overall modeling stages.
Predict an input of a new client based on the deployed site.
